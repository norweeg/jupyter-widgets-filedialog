# Jupyter File Dialog

File Open/Save and Directory Selection hybrid widgets based on [Jupyter Widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide.html) and [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dialog.html#module-tkinter.filedialog)

The goal of this project is to provide interactive file dialog widgets fully compatible with the Jupyter Widgets API without adding additional dependencies beyond what Jupyter Widgets already requires.
